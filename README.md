# 💫 About Me

🎓 **Recently completed:** Full‑Stack Developer Internship @ **spaceSHIFT A. A. GmbH** – built production‑ready **Go** APIs with **PostgreSQL**, created **React/TypeScript** frontends for testing, and deployed containerized applications using **Docker** and **GitLab CI/CD**.

💻 **Currently diving into:** LPIC deep-dive (transitioning from Windows to Ubuntu for hands-on Linux system administration) and seeking new **junior developer opportunities** in Berlin or remote.

🚀 **What I bring to the table:**
* **Backend expertise:** RESTful APIs, clean architecture, database migrations, authentication systems
* **Full-stack mindset:** From database design to frontend testing and containerized deployments
* **Systems thinking:** Understanding how applications run in production environments
* **Continuous learner:** Former translator who pivoted to tech with strong problem-solving skills

🤝 **I love collaborating on:**
* Open‑source tools that make development more efficient and inclusive
* Backend services that turn complex requirements into elegant, maintainable APIs
* Projects where technical excellence meets real-world impact
* Mentoring opportunities where we learn together

🌱 **Currently mastering:**
* Advanced Go patterns, testing strategies, and performance optimization
* Linux system administration and shell scripting (LPIC 101/102 path)
* Production PostgreSQL: query optimization, indexing, and database design
* Container orchestration and cloud deployment patterns

💬 **Ask me about:**
* Building RESTful APIs with Go and clean architecture principles
* Transitioning from humanities to tech (I'm a former professional translator!)
* Database migrations, schema design, and PostgreSQL best practices
* Containerizing applications and setting up CI/CD pipelines
* Balancing creative problem-solving with systematic engineering

📍 **Location:** Berlin, Germany | **Status:** 🔍 **Open to Work**
